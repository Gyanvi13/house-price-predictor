# House Price predictor Model
 A Machine Learning project designed to predict house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of rooms, and more. This project leverages advanced regression techniques to build a robust model capable of providing accurate predictions, assisting users in making informed real estate decisions.  Features Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends, correlations, and key insights about the dataset. Model Training: Utilizes popular regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Model Evaluation: Includes metrics such as RÂ² score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) for performance analysis. Interactive Predictions: A user-friendly interface (if applicable) for testing the model with custom inputs. Technology Stack Programming Language: Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn Tools: Jupyter Notebook Dataset The dataset contains detailed information about houses, including:  Features: Area, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, year built, location, etc. Target Variable: House price.
